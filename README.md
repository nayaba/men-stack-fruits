# ![[tktk Module Name] - Solution Code](./internal-resources/assets/tktk-hero.png)

## Builder instructions

Some general notes as you construct this module:

- ***This entire repo may be student-facing. Keep this in mind as you add content to it.***
- When adding solution code, treat the directory that holds this README file as the root of the project. Do not bundle solution code inside of a child directory. 
- This README should not provide any information beyond a simple intro to simplify maintenance. The main lab repo should hold all background information about the solution code. Do not duplicate that work here. 
- Do not add links to any other module from this module.
- tktk Delete the entire **Builder instructions** section and all its subsections after you've wrapped up work here. ***None of this content should remain***.
